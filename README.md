# neetcode cpp
I'm currently revising BLIND 75 questions available on neetcode But with C++ instead of Python.

I might probably merge the two repos into one, or just make them as submodules, but as of right now I think it's fine to keep them separately.

Hope to get used to C++ a bit more with this. Planning on Rust next, though I heard not all of blind 75 questions are available for free on leetcode? Idrk.
